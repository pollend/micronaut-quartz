## Documentation

See the [Documentation](https://pollend.github.io/micronaut-quartz/snapshot) for more information. 

## Examples

Examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/pollend/micronaut-quartz/tree/master/docs-examples) directory.

## Snapshots and Releases

Snaphots are automatically published to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/pollend/maven/micronaut-quartz) using [Github Actions](https://github.com/pollend/micronaut-quartz/actions).

See the documentation in the [Micronaut Docs](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#usingsnapshots) for how to configure your build to use snapshots.

Releases are completely automated. To perform a release use the following steps:

* [Publish the draft release](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-xxx/releases). There should be already a draft release created, edit and publish it. The Git Tag should start with `v`. For example `v1.0.0`.
* [Monitor the Workflow](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-xxx/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) to check it passed successfully.
* Celebrate!
